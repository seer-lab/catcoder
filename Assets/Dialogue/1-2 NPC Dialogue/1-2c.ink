Great work out there teammate! We successfully secured enough for our first shipment today!
You are the first competant worker I've had in ages, and you don't even work here!
Since this is the first opportunity we've had in a while, lets take advantage of those skills and make some master grade scratching posts! For someone of your caliber, this should be no problem!
To achieve this we need to tune the factory differently... it's time to engage the 'for loop' assembly line. Instead of constant production, we will focus on one at a time for best results.
Please check the sign for the requirements again, and store them. We will also need to get rid of the low quality products, so just dispose of them in the waste bin here.
