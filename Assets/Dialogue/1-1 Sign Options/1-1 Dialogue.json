Come in quick and help with this madness.","\n","^We are working around the clock, but we need an extra pair of paws to find the perfect recipe! You have heard about <i>variables and data types</i> before right?","\n","^NO??","\n","^Well let me give you a quick rundown of how they work.","\n","^Data types and variables are very important, but also very simple! You know them in every day life, but have yet to use them in this way.","\n","^Take my name for example, this is what we call a character type.","\n","^Here, take this bowl and see what I mean.","\n","^You did it! A character type can be names, places, or even number if you want it that way!","\n","^Hmm... that doesn't seem right. Remember, what does my name represent? Try again, I'll this this up.","\n","^Since you clearly know what you are doing, try and figure out what these ones do too.","\n","^You made it! I only doubted you for a second! Now that you know what data types are, you must be wondering what a variable is too?","\n","^Well a variable is simple just a key word you use, and a data type is what's assigned to it... easy, right?","\n","^For instance, myName = \"Scruffy\" defines me just fine!","\n","^Well you seem to be an expert now, so it's time to get to work! We need Little Spot's food ready to serve pronto!","\n","^I can still hear her howling in the distance...
